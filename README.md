<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The engineering thesis focuses on the application of machine learning to analyze do-
mestic hot water consumption, considering weekly and seasonal correlations. The data
processing process, as well as the selection of architecture and hyperparameters, were dis-
cussed, utilizing historical data to enhance model predictions. Subsequently, the impact of
atmospheric conditions on the efficiency of the heating system was examined using three
methods, and their implementation accuracy was verified by adding a crucial parameter.
The final stage involved applying the proposed model to simulate the dynamics of water
temperature in the tank, using a tuned controller. Optimization was also conducted using
an objective function based on cost and comfort functions.
